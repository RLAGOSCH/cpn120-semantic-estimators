README - fEstimadores
======================

This folder contains all R functions used to compute semantic richness estimators 

These estimators are non-parametric and are adapted from biodiversity estimation methods, 
such as Chao2 and its bias-corrected version, as well as a heuristic estimator 
that excludes low-frequency properties.

CONTENTS
--------------------------------------------------------

1. fEstimadores.R
-----------------
Main wrapper function that calls all estimators and returns a standardized data frame 
with point estimates, variances, and confidence intervals for each method. 
Useful in simulation pipelines or batch processing of concepts.

Output columns:
  - Q1 to Q4: number of properties mentioned exactly 1, 2, 3, or 4 times
  - nT: number of participants
  - U: total number of mentions
  - Sobs: observed richness
  - Scut: truncated richness (cutoff at Q4)
  - Schao2: Chao2 richness estimator with variance and 95% CI
  - Schao2BC: Bias-corrected Chao2 richness estimator with variance and 95% CI

2. fShat.R
----------
Implements the Chao2 estimator (Schao2) and its log-normal confidence interval.
Uses Q1 and Q2 to estimate unobserved richness, with a fallback when Q2 = 0.

3. fShat_bc.R
-------------
Implements the bias-corrected Chao2 estimator (Schao2BC) using Q1 and Q2+1 in the denominator.
Provides variance and log-normal confidence interval.

4. fScut.R
----------
Truncated richness estimator that sums all Q_i for i ≥ 5.
Designed to exclude rare features (Q1–Q4) which are highly sensitive to sampling variability.

5. ffGetQ.R
-----------
Auxiliary function that converts an incidence matrix (binary matrix: features × participants) 
into a Q-vector, where Q_i is the number of features mentioned by exactly i participants.

--------------------------------------------------------
NOTES
--------------------------------------------------------

- All functions are written to be compatible with `vQ` vectors derived from 
  incidence matrices via `ffGetQ()`.

- Confidence intervals follow the log-normal approximation described in 
  Canessa et al. (2020), tailored for richness estimators.

- These functions assume binary, row-wise feature aggregation (i.e., feature counts per concept).

- All outputs are clean and ready for data.frame concatenation or further analysis.
